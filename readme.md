# ViewShed
ViewShed is GIS software written in JavaScript that aims to be a simple replacement for the various 'view shed' options available out there.  It bootstraps itself completely and does not require specifying DEMs, etc.  Best of all - it actually does the job it purports to do, fast!  Unlike the odd, confusing outputs generated by other solutions.

## Dependencies
ViewShed is currently only working on top of the (fantastic) [ESRI](http://esri.com) JS API.  I welcome contributions to generalize the software to other JS GIS platforms.

## Installation
1. Grab viewshed.js
2. Load viewshed.js into your page, via script tag or your favorite AMD loader.
3. On document load, call ViewShedInit().
4. Voila!  ViewShed will listen to clicks on your map (see Dependencies, above) and just work as a 'view shed' should obviously work.
